# The Clear Console Toolkit

[![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-C%2B%2B%20%26%20C%2B%2B20%2C%20Win32-blue)](https://github.com/GeorgePimpleton/misc_files/)

A Win32 API library to clear the contents of a console mode window.  This was more experimentation, not something useful.

## Usage

There are two separate versions of the Clear Console Toolkit: a pre C++20 header only version and a C++20 module interface file.  Use only one of the files!

See the example .cpp files for basic "how to" instructions.

### Notes

There may be links to websites or internet sources in these pages. Links can go stale. A search engine is your friend.

If you find the files and examples useful let me know, if you find better ways to craft the code really let me know!

## Warning

The .cppm module interface file require using C++20 (or later) as your language standard.  Currently there is only one compiler/IDE that can use modules: Visual Studio 2022.

Use either the header or module interface file, do not use both!
