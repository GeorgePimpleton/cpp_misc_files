# Miscellaneous C++ files

0. Several C++ ISO Committee working group papers on C++11's <random> library.
    a. Random Number Generation in C++11 - WG21 N3551.pdf
    b. Three random-related Proposals - WG21 N3547

  A collection of custome C++ header-only/module interface files I created for doing simple tasks.

1. The Random Toolkit.  Makes using the C++ <random> library almost as easy as the C library random functions.

If you find the files useful let me know, if you find better ways to craft the code really let me know!
