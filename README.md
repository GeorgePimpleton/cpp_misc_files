# Miscellaneous C++ library header files

This is a collection of C++ header-only/module interface files I created for doing simple tasks.

1. The Random Toolkit.  Makes using the C++ <random> library almost as easy as the C library random functions.

2. The C++ Group working paper I used to construct the rng toolkit.  WG21 N3551.pdf
