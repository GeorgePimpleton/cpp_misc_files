# The Console Color Toolkit
[![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-C%2B%2B%20%26%20C%2B%2B20%2C%20Win32-blue)](https://github.com/GeorgePimpleton/misc_files/)

A Win32 API library so a console mode app can be colorful.

Adapted from an old CPlusPlus artice: "Add color to your console 2" https://cplusplus.com/articles/Eyhv0pDG/

## Usage
There are two separate versions of the Console Color Toolkit: a pre C++20 header only version and a C++20 module interface file.  Use only one of the files!

See the example .cpp files for basic "how to" instructions.

### Notes
There may be links to websites or internet sources in these pages. Links can go stale. A search engine is your friend.

If you find the files and examples useful let me know, if you find better ways to craft the code really let me know!

The file(s) are provided as-is, no warranty or suitability for use is even implied.

## Warning
The .cppm module interface file require using C++20 (or later) as your language standard.  Currently there is only one compiler/IDE that can use modules: Visual Studio 2022.

Use either the header or module interface file, do not use both!
